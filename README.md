## Inspiration
Each dumpster dived item was still edible and each had some form of date labeling present on it. Items were pulled directly from retailer trash piles randomly selected from the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood in New York City.

I want to analyze the dataset about these dumpster dive items. The data have info about date-labeled, still-edible food items dumpster dived on randomly selected weeks from randomly selected retail sites in downtown Brooklyn, NY. 

## What it does
Using Mage AI to analyze ranking and data about dumpster dive items and food waste. 

## How we built it
We use Mage AI to analyze our data. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to prepare the data, clean up the data, and figure out how to use Mage AI. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get the dataset, use Mage AI and successfully train the model 

## What we learned
We learnt to use Mage AI to train dataset and get data analytic insight about the data. 

## What's next for Food Waste Analysis
We see how easy it is to use Mage AI and want to apply using it more in our work and study.
